# Satellite Image Classification ADD VISUALIZATIONS

This project aims to classify satellite images into four categories: cloudy areas, deserts, green areas, and bodies of water. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the project addresses the problem of land cover analysis, providing valuable insights into ecosystems and climate change.

## Goal
This project utilizes machine learning to solve a real-world problem: classifying satellite images of land cover types. The development of an accurate classifier aims to contribute to environmental monitoring, climate change analysis, and sustainable development. The project has practical applications in sectors such as agriculture, urban planning, and disaster relief. Beyond the technical focus, it demonstrates the potential impact of data-driven tools to support informed decision-making and environmental protection.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains **5631 images**, divided into four classes: Cloudy, Desert, Green Area, and Water. Each class has approximately 1300 images. This data was sourced from [Kaggle's Satellite Image Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification/data).
